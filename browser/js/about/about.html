                My passion for photography began in high school when my Dad gave me my first camera. Growing up with my Dad was a photo-filled adventure. With his camera always by his side, he documented my childhood (and now adulthood) from birthday parties, to random special moments at home, to vacations in near and far away places. So, naturally, my love for photography began to grow at a very young age. I picked up my first camera that one day in high school and I haven’t stopped since. I took photography classes all throughout high school, at Greens Farms Academy, and then, during my four years at Bates College, I took two photography classes and also led the photography team for the Bates student newspaper. All the while, I continued, and continue, to take photographs on my own time. I have been fortunate enough to travel many places around the world, including Milan where I studied abroad from January 2012 to May 2012. Many of the pictures that you see are from far away places, with the exception of many from my wanderings within the U.S. I consider myself a very versatile photographer in that I love taking pictures of almost everything, but in my portfolio you will mostly see pictures geared towards the landscapes category, as I feel this is one of my stronger areas. Through a photography class that I took at Bates, I also developed a strong interest in studio photography, shown by my photo series entitled “Lights”. I always have been, and always will be, a Canon follower. I currently shoot on a Canon 60D, but many were taken with my Canon 50D and Canon Rebel XT. Thanks for visiting and hope you enjoy!
